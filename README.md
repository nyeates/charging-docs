# charging-docs
This repository contains documentation for the [Chargeback](https://github.com/rhus/manageiq/) project implemented within [ManageIQ](https://www.manageiq.org).

There are several places that house documentation:

- What you are seeing now is the user and administrator documentation.
- You can find requirements in the document
- Developer documentation is in the code :D

Please go to the *wiki* (https://github.com/rhus/charging-docs/wiki) to see and make changes on the requirements

You can also look at the documentation for:
- Tariff plan and rate definitions. How we are rating. Tiers, discounts, definitions, all there
- Guiding: associating rates to groups. You need to associate rates to users or groups, here you can find how.
- Exporting the data: how to create chargeback reports and CDR. Sometimes you don't just rate, you need to use that information somewhere.
- CDR description: a quick description of CDR format. Exporting is good, and with this you can feed a rating engine or an ERP
- Input data description. How to make external data into the application. Let's make it a generic tool


Our current roadmap and Scrum board is at:
